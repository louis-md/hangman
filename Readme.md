## Project Description üìù
This is a game of "hangman".
The basic principle is that the user has to guess all the letters of a word. 
The game is won if he or she succeeds. 
However, there are a limited number of guesses before the user is...hung. 

## Rules üìê
The program will generate a random word.
You will be invited to input a letter. 
If the letter is in the word, good for you, it will appear at it's place in the word. 
If the letter is not in the word, you will use one of your "guesses". 
You only have ten wrong guesses, so choose your letters wisely !


## Workflow üóÇÔ∏è
Our first task was to set up collaboration tools (a direct group message in Discord, installing VSCode on each of our computers, creating and cloning a github repository).
To vizualise what the program should do, we started by drawing a quick and dirty flowchart. 
We made a list of all the tasks for the day, based on the instructions in the project definition page, and included them in the Jira kanban board.
We got started on the pseudocode, which was the longest task, as it required both agreeing on the different steps and already identifying the variables, operators and functions we would need. 
Once we had a satisfying pseudocode, we started coding in an iterative manner (i.e. testing frequently to see what was working or not). Once we felt the game was working well enough, we added a couple "bonus" options that we had identified in the morning : ascii art to depict the hanging person, an option for a two player-game, random list generation. 
During the day, we also regularly updated our kanban and cleaned up our flowchart. Our last tasks were to prepare the slides for the presentation and this readme.md file. 
And then we had a beer !

## Organization üóìÔ∏è
We used a kanban board but did not find it very useful in this case, since the tasks were all done in common. 
A simple to-do list would have sufficed. 

Our repository includes : 
- this readme file
- a pseudocode file in markdown, which was the first version of our project; 
- a jupyter notebook named hangwoman.ipynb, which includes the code for the game; 
- the flowchart in draw.io and png format 
- the presentation of the projet in powerpoint format
